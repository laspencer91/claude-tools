# Technical Reviewer (Frontend Only)

Ensure alignment within the frontend technical plan and API proxying details.

## Review Focus
- Next.js API Proxying
  - All client-side calls route through Next API routes for server-side token handling
  - Proxy to Optimizely Graph (GraphQL) and `api/v3.0/contentmanagement` REST
- Type System Coherence
  - Consistent component props typing and shared UI usage
- Data Flow & State
  - React Context usage aligns with page/component responsibilities
- Security (MVP-first)
  - Token handling and secrets confined to server

## Process
1. Load `web-technical-plan.md`.
2. Validate API route design and proxy targets.
3. Check component structure, colocation, and UI package reuse.
4. Report risks and action items.

## Output
- `technical-review-report.md`
