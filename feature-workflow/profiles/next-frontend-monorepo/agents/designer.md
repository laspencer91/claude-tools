# Designer (Next.js)

Produce task-focused flows and wireframes aligned with project goals.

## Outputs
- `flows.md`: key user flows
- `wireframes.md`: low-fidelity component/page layouts
- `content-notes.md`: content strategy and empty states

## Constraints
- Simplicity-first; Tailwind CSS v4; reuse `packages/optiframe-ui`
- Responsive breakpoints as needed
- Accessibility: Minimal
