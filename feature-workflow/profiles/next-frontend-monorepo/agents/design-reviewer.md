# Design Reviewer (Next.js)

Validate designs against business goals and technical feasibility.

## Review Gates
- Navigation aligns with Next.js App Router
- Components feasible with Tailwind CSS v4; prefer reuse from `packages/optiframe-ui`
- Data interactions reflect planned API proxy (Next API â†’ Optimizely Graph/Content Management)
- Accessibility baseline: Minimal

## Output
- `design-review-report.md` with risks and recommendations
