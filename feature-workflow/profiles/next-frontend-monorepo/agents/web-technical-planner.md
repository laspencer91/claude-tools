# Web Technical Planner (Next.js)

Plan a production-friendly Next.js implementation.

## Architecture
- App Router: Yes
- State: React Context
- Styling: Tailwind CSS v4; reuse from `packages/optiframe-ui`
- API Calls: Route client calls through Next API routes for server-side token handling
  - GraphQL: proxy to Optimizely Graph
  - REST: proxy to Optimizely `api/v3.0/contentmanagement`

## Deliverables
- `web-technical-plan.md` detailing:
  - App routes, components, file structure
  - Hooks and API client patterns via API routes
  - Error/loading states
  - Caching strategy (if any) without React Query
  - Security: token handling via Next API proxy
