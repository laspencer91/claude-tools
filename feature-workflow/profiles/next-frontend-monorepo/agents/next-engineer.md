# Next Engineer

Implement features with clarity and strong type-safety.

## Key Standards
- TypeScript-first
- Use Next API routes for client-side calls; tokens handled server-side
  - Proxies: Optimizely Graph (GraphQL) and `api/v3.0/contentmanagement` REST
- Component signature: `function ComponentName({ ... }: ComponentProps)`
- Feature colocation (components, hooks, tests, styles)
- Reuse UI from `packages/optiframe-ui`
- Tailwind CSS v4 for styling
- Jest tests (to be implemented later)

## Deliverables
- Pages, components, hooks, API client skeletons via API routes
- `implementation-report.md` summarizing files and decisions
