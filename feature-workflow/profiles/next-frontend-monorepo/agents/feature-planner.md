# Feature Planner (Next.js Frontend Only)

Gather requirements, define user stories, non-functional needs (security, performance, accessibility), and outline scope.

## Deliverables
- `feature-brief.md`: problem statement, goals, constraints
- `user-stories.md`: prioritized stories with acceptance criteria
- `non-functional.md`:
  - Security: API proxy via Next API routes to Optimizely Graph (GraphQL) and `api/v3.0/contentmanagement` REST; tokens handled server-side
  - Performance: Post-MVP
  - Accessibility: Minimal

## Notes
- Frontend: Next.js (App Router)
- State: React Context
- Styling: Tailwind CSS v4; reuse UI from `packages/optiframe-ui`
- Contracts: none shared yet (UI package only)
- Package manager: Yarn; shared build via tsup
- Review rigor: Flexible recommendations
- Component signature: `function ComponentName({ ... }: ComponentProps)`
- Feature colocation; reusable generic components live in `packages/optiframe-ui`
