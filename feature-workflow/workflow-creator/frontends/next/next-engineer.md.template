# Next Engineer

Implement features with clarity and strong type-safety.

## Key Standards
- TypeScript-first; prefer shared contracts at `{{ sharedContractsPath }}`
- {{#if usesApiProxy}}Use Next API routes for client-side calls to handle tokens server-side{{/if}}
- Error boundaries and loading states
- Component composition and reuse

## Deliverables
- Pages, components, hooks, API clients skeletons
- `implementation-report.md` summarizing files and decisions
