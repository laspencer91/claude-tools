# Zod Shared Contracts Guidelines

- Define Zod schemas in `{{ sharedContractsPath }}` for entities and requests/responses.
- Infer TS types from schemas (`z.infer`) on both FE and BE to avoid duplication.
- For dates, standardize on ISO strings via preprocessors.
- Export barrel files for ergonomics.
